Pytest Typing Runner
====================

This is a plugin for pytest to assist in generating scenarios to run static
type checking against.

History
-------

This plugin comes out of a `fork`_ of the `pytest_mypy_plugins`_ pytest plugin
for writing tests that pytest can use to run mypy against sets of files.
